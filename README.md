# Eight Queens Solution by Hill Climbing

This is a super simple solution to the Eight Queens problem by using Hill Climbing. I had to tutor this, despite knowing neither the problem nor the algorithm so I decided to write it myself to better understand it. I wrote this in a day so please forgive the inefficiencies (I know there are way too many for loops).
